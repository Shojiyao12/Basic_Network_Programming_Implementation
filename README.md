# Basic_Network_Programming_Implementation
A network simulator for testing reliable data transfer protocols in Python. This simulator implements two key protocols:  Stop-and-Wait: Sends one packet at a time and waits for an acknowledgment before sending the next. Go-Back-N: Uses a sliding window mechanism to send multiple packets before requiring an acknowledgment.
